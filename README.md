# PointClass
A Point class with driver code

## Key Features:
1. Point Class:
   * Constructors:
      * Default constructor initializes x and y to 0.0.
      * Parameterized constructor initializes x and y to given values.
   * Operator Overloads:
      * operator==: Compares two Point objects for equality based on their coordinates.
      * operator-: Computes the Euclidean distance between two Point objects.
  * Getters: GetX() and GetY() to retrieve the x and y coordinates.
  * Setters: SetX(double) and SetY(double) to modify the x and y coordinates.
2. Test Driver:
  * Demonstrates the use of the constructors, setters, getters, and overloaded operators.
  * Tests the distance calculation and equality comparison between points.
